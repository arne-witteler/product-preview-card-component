### What I learned

This challenge helped me practice building a fully responsive card layout with semantic HTML and clean, scalable CSS architecture.

Key takeaways:

- How to use `srcset` and `sizes` attributes to serve the appropriate image depending on screen width.
- Structuring mobile-first CSS that scales up cleanly using `@media` queries.
- Managing consistent spacing and visual alignment with flexible containers.
